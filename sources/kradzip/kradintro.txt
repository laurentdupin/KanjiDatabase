# This is the data file from which the "radkfile" is made, which in turn
# drives the multi-radical lookup method in XJDIC, WWWJDIC and possibly 
# other dictionary and related software.
# 
# The file is based on work done in 1994/1995 by Michael Raine in which he
# analyzed all the JIS1/2 kanji and identified the constituent radicals and 
# other common elements, with the intention of facilitating the selection of
# kanji within a dictionary program by identifying multiple elements.
# The file was revised by Jim Breen in September 1995. Further revisions were
# done in 1998/9 at the suggestion of Wolfgang Conrath, then a revision was
# carried out in 2001 using suggestions from Yutaka Ohno based on a similar
# decomposition made by Kobayashi. Further amendments were made in July
# 2001 after suggestions from Hendrik.
#
# The file has been updated on numerous occasions since then.
# 
# The file consists of 6,355 lines of text; one for each of the 
# JIS X 0208-1997 kanji. Each line is a follows:
# - the kanji itself,
# - a space followed by a colon (:) followed by a space,
# - one or more radicals/elements which can be seen in the kanji. These
#   are drawn from JIS X 0208-1997. Where the element alone is not in
#   JIS X 0208, a kanji which contains the element is used instead.
#
# The decomposition is based on what can be seen in typical kanji
# glyphs. Elements themselves can be further subdivided. For example,
# ﾀ・is an element and so is ｸ, so the elements in ﾏﾃ are <ｸ ﾀ・ｸﾀ>.
# 
# The elements used have been drawn from JIS X 0208. As this codeset
# does not contain the exact elements, characters have been chosen
# which contain the element. For example, 鉅 is used for the kusa-kanmuri
# element at the top, and ﾋｮ is used for the kozato element on the right.
#
# The mappings of the characters used to the characters in the Unicode,
# mostly in the, "CJK Radicals Supplement" and "KangXi Radicals", are below.
